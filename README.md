# Text-Emotion-Detection

This project is about performing emotion detection from text using PyTorch.

For this project, I implemented an NLP task of creating a model to detect the emotion from text using PyTorch where I created a Deep Neural Network using GloVe Word Embeddings, LSTMs and fully connected layers.

GloVe Embedding used: glove.6B.50d.txt
The embedding can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt

Results:
I was able to succesfully create a model that could achieve an accuracy of 82.3% in my training set.
